# pc2mesh

Deep convolutional neural network transforming 3D point cloud data to a mesh.
Based on [pixel2mesh](https://github.com/nywang16/Pixel2Mesh), which allows to learn the deformation of a mesh represented as a graph.
And [flexconvolution](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/Flex-Convolution) to learn features of points in three dimensional space
