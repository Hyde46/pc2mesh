  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a highly accurate and precise multi-view, multi-projector, and multi-pattern phase scanning method for shape acquisition that is able to handle occlusions and optically challenging materials. The 3D reconstruction is formulated as a two-step process which first estimates reliable measurement samples and then simultaneously optimizes over all cameras, projectors, and patterns. This holistic approach results in significant quality improvements. Furthermore, the acquisition time is drastically reduced by relying on just six high-frequency sinusoidal captures without the need of phase unwrapping, which is implicitly provided by the multi-view geometry.},
