\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}
This chapter outlines the theory on which this work is based on, as well as different approaches to surface reconstruction from complete or lacking object data.
Roter Faden:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Representing objects with meshes has many useful applications
  \item List different representations of objects (meshes, pointcloud, voxels,..)
  \item Is a form of data transformation and extrapolation of missing information
  \item Two main approaches for transformation, ml and classical approaches
\end{enumerate}
\todo{Die alternativen richtungen von lensch noch}

\section{Non-machine learning background ;p}
Roter Faden:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item classic approaches here
  \item find more of a story after researching more
  \item non trivial task  (etwas mathematischer, genauer werden)
\end{enumerate}
Papers to cite here
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Marching cubes
  \item ask dennis. he prob has a bunch
  \item cite his stuff too ?
  \item find more classic papers
  \item instant field aligned meshes
  \item dennis sein zeug ist wohl sehr gut
\end{enumerate}

\section{Machine Learning Background}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item machine learning good way for inference, probably neural network too, given huge amount of data and finding similarities in data
  \item many approaches for surface reconstruction in classic ml
  \item used for self driving cars. Fast solutions
  \item NN recently started to get nice results
  \item many try to transform given input data to voxel based representation
  \item not many directly from point cloud to meshes
  \item range scanner to meshes
  \item end result not meshes?
\end{enumerate}
