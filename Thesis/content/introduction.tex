\chapter{Introduction}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item robotics, interact with real world
    \item understand env
    \item what is it, they are working with
    \item autonomous driving 
    \item thus object analysis 
    \item digitize objects somehow
    \item round about of different kinds already present
    \item List different representations of objects (meshes, pointcloud, voxels,structured light, kinect depth..)
    \item lots of data readily available
    \item present novel network configurations deep learning based
    \item end to end solution for shape inference from PC to mesh
    \item some modified loss functions for good results
    \item determine how well it is doing this functions
    \item compare to work doing similar things
    \item non learning based/ learning based
    \item maybe small user study??
  \end{enumerate}
