\chapter{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

Often in computer graphics, it is necessary to process three-dimensional real-world or digital objects for reconstruction, remeshing or analytical applications. There are many ways to acquire data of the surface of such geometry and more so many techniques to transform and augment that data to different representations. This often non-trivial task is crucial to further process the object in question in later stages of their respective pipeline. Over the years many representations of acquisition data formats and transformation methods, as well as target data formats, have accumulated.\\
In this chapter, various of these techniques and data formats are examined, of which some of them are used in this work as a vehicle for a novel data transformation routine.\\
Initially, classical approaches are examined in section \ref{classic_approaches} which do not rely on artificial intelligence or machine learning methods.
With the recent advances in machine learning, and more so deep learning, many new approaches have been developed and thus considered in this work.
Hence, machine learning based methods are reassessed in section \ref{ml_approaches} which rely on distinctive statistical features in their initial data format or the dataset itself, thus allowing for the transformation.

\section{Classical approaches}
\label{classic_approaches}
  In this chapter, classical approaches are examined which do not rely on machine
  learning to transform data of objects from one format to another. 

  In general, a three-dimensional object may be specified by its representation of the
  surface. This representation varies from unstructured point cloud data in three-dimensional space
  to a graph-based representation like triangle-/ or quad-meshes and even poly meshes
  with more than four neighbors per node. Information on the object's surface may also be described
  by three-dimensional discrete scalar field (~Voxels~).  Often the information on an object's
  surface is only partially defined, where some information may be missing. 
  This can be due to acquisition methods, where parts of the object are partially 
  concealed or recorded from insufficient many sides, or that information is not available.

  Starting from these representations of an object's surface, there are many methods 
  of transformation to reach another state of representation. 
  Transforming the data not only makes further processing easier
  but rather during their process, more data on the surface is 
  computed based on the given input data.

  This task is non-trivial since, from one representation of an object's
  surface, many reconstructions in the form of another representation 
  are possible. The amount of data of the object's surface can never
  be entirely perfect, as the resolution is chosen arbitrarily, thus leading to many reconstruction methods.
  In this section, some of the more important works on this subject of data transformation are examined, with 
  an overview of the different input and output data formats applicable. 

 \subsection{Transformation methods}
 \todo{maybe not needed. only classic approaches as section?}

  One of the earliest, but still well-known algorithms, presented by
  Lorensen et al. \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCH:37402.37422}, the marching cubes algorithm, reconstructs the surface information of an object as a
  triangle mesh, given three-dimensional medical data. This data is provided in the form of
  voxels. 
  During the reconstruction process, the algorithm iterates through all voxels. For each of these positions, up to eight occupied positions of the voxel-grid can be considered. Furthermore, a reconstruction configuration is defined for every configuration of present/non-present positions in the neighborhood of the voxel. Thus, leading to $2^8 = (256)$ possible configurations, where 15 of them are unique, and the rest are generated by the rotation of the base configurations.  Every configuration reconstructs a number of polygons given one voxel configuration. Finally, all polygons created this way are merged into one mesh.

  A more recent work by Groh et al.\cite{Groh2017} presents a way to digitalize real-world objects by projecting shifted sinusoid patterns by multiple projectors onto the object. This is captured by multiple cameras. By combining the shifted patterns and highly accurate created features, a precise bundle adjustment is performed. Thus, all projector-camera pairs for each surface point can be estimated and used to optimize the final depth information.
  \todo{Actually not sure if this fits here}

  By all means, digitalizing real-world objects not only revolves on structured light but also may make use of range scanners, which measure the depth from the recording device to a point on the surface of the object. Additionally, this depth information may be combined from recording from multiple views. Assembling this information yields unstructured three-dimensional point cloud data. 

  Similar to the marching cubes algorithm, the work presented by 
  Bernardini et al. \cite{817351}, the ball-pivoting algorithm, 
  interpolates the surface of an object given the input data.
  In contrast, the algorithm processes such a collection of unstructured 
  three-dimensional points in space with their orientation on the
  ground truth surface and returns a triangle mesh. Starting from
  a seed triangle, for each edge of not already processed triangles
  , a sphere with set radius $r$ revolves around it. If another point
  of the input point cloud intersects with the sphere, a triangle is 
  created out of the endpoints of the considered edge and the newly 
  found point, thus creating a triangle mesh if every edge of each 
  triangle has been considered. 
  

  Furthermore, the Poisson surface reconstruction, 
  presented by Kazhdan et al. \cite{Kazhdan:2006:PSR:1281957.1281965}, also processes a
  collection of unstructured points in three-dimensional
  space with surface orientation. Solving the Poisson problem 
  \cite{Genovese2006} assuming the isosurface of the surface can be 
  approximated by the normal field, thus yielding the
  indicator function. This function results in non-zero
  values close to the surface of the object and thereby 
  can be directly extracted. The problem is then reduced to a 
  form of voxel-grid, thus can be transformed by the marching
  cubes algorithm.

  Similarly, if not only samples on the surface are provided, 
  but also their orientation, a high-resolution quad- or 
  tri-dominant mesh can be reconstructed, as described in the 
  work by Jakob et al. \cite{}. Although not limited to PC data,
  it is able to process from a hundred thousand up to several
  hundred million data points in only seconds of calculation time.
  While other methods rely on global optimization problems, this work 
  specifically does not rely on such methods, scaling linearly with 
  the data input size, thus leading to such fast calculation times.

  Even though many different techiniques on surface scanning have been
  developed over the years, obtaining the sampled surface point orientations,
  connectivity or even topological adjacency is not always possible.

  
  Without any of these sometimes crucial information, surface information still can be reconstructed by
  calculating the PC's medial axis transform ~(~MAT~) from unstructured point cloud
  data, followed by an inverse transformation.  The medial axis of a PC
  is described as a set of points where each point is the closest neighbor 
  to at least one other point in the original PC. Not only can the PC be noisy 
  or scanty, as described by Amenta et al. \cite{Amenta:2001:PC:376957.376986}, but the reconstructed
  surface mesh will always be manifold.

  In more recent work by Bukenberger et al. \cite{bukenberger2018hierarchical},
  reconstruction of manifold quad faced meshes from 
  scanned three-dimensional geometry without additional
  information on surface orientation, connectivity or topological
  adjacency is explored. Like in the previously described work,
  differing sampling densities on the surface procure no severe 
  limitation during the reconstruction process. This process takes
  advantage of clustering nearby points, and computing 
  representatives for each of them with the help of a kd-tree 
  leaf structure. Thus, leading to a coherent tile structure 
  of the surface. 



\section{Machine Learning based approaches}
\label{ml_approaches}
With more advanced acquisition methods, higher computing power 
and high-speed connectivity over the internet, gathering, interchanging
 and expanding big datasets are getting progressively more prevalent
  and important (\todo{cite modelnet, other big data sets online?}) . 
  Thus, allowing for statistical and data-driven algorithms to 
  analyze big datasets, to compute characteristics and similarities
   within. 
   
   In this section, machine learning based approaches are inspected which learn features from big datasets and utilize gained knowledge to infer information on an object's surface given varied input data.
Furthermore, this section establishes a frame for this work in 
contrast to the current, as well as older techniques for data 
transformation from diverse object datasets to a final reconstruction
 of surface information.
