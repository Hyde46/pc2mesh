Often in computer graphics, it is necessary to process three-dimensional objects. There are many ways to acquire data of the surface of such geometry and more so many techniques to transform and augment that data to distinct representations. This often non-trivial task is crucial to further process the object in question in later stages of their respective pipeline. Over the years many representations of acquisition data formats and transformation methods, as well as target data formats, have accumulated.\\
In this chapter, various of these techniques and data formats are examined, of which some of them are used in this work as a vehicle for a novel data transformation routine.\\
Initially, classical approaches are examined in section \ref{classic_approaches} which do not rely on artificial intelligence or machine learning methods.
With the recent advances in deep learning, many new approaches have been developed and thus considered in this work.
Subsequently, machine learning based methods are reassessed in section \ref{ml_approaches} which rely on distinctive statistical features in their initial data format or the dataset itself, thus allowing for the transformation.

\section{Classical approaches}
\label{classic_approaches}
In this chapter, classical approaches are examined which do not rely on machine
 learning to transform data of objects from one format to another. 

In general, a three-dimensional object may be specified by its representation of the
 surface. This representation varies from unstructured point cloud data in three-dimensional space
  to a graph-based representation like triangle-/ or quad-meshes and even poly meshes
   with more than four neighbors per node. Information on the object's surface may also be described
    by three-dimensional discrete scalar field (~Voxels~).  Often the information on an object's
     surface is only partially defined, where some information may be missing. 
     This can be due to acquisition methods, where parts of the object are partially 
     concealed or recorded from insufficient many sides, or that information is not available.

Starting from these representations of an object's surface, there are many methods 
of transformation to reach another state of representation. 
Transforming the data not only makes further processing easier
 but rather during their process, more data on the surface is 
 computed based on the given input data.

 This task is non-trivial since, from one representation of an object's surface, many reconstructions in the form of another representation are possible. The amount of data of the object's surface can never be perfect, as the resolution is arbitrary, thus leading to many injective reconstruction methods.
 In this section, some of the more important works on this subject of data transformation are examined, with 
 an overview of the different input and output formats available. 

 \subsection{Transformation methods}
 \todo{maybe not needed. only classic approaches as section?}

One of the earliest, but still well-known algorithms, presented by
 Lorensen et al. \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCH:37402.37422}, the marching cubes algorithm, reconstructs the surface information of an object as a
  triangle mesh, given three-dimensional medical data. This data is provided in the form of
   voxels. 
During the reconstruction process, the algorithm iterates through all voxels. For each of these positions, up to eight occupied positions of the voxel-grid can be considered. Furthermore, a reconstruction configuration is defined for every configuration of present/non-present positions in the neighborhood of the voxel. Thus, leading to $2^8 = (256)$ possible configurations, where 15 of them are unique, and the rest are generated by the rotation of the base configurations.  Every configuration reconstructs a number of polygons given one voxel configuration. Finally, all polygons created this way are merged into one mesh.
 
A more recent work by Groh et al.\cite{Groh2017} presents a way to digitalize real-world objects by projecting shifted sinusoid patterns by multiple projectors onto the object. This is captured by multiple cameras. By combining the shifted patterns and highly accurate created features, a precise bundle adjustment is performed. Thus, all projector-camera pairs for each surface point can be estimated and used to optimize the final depth information.
\todo{Actually not sure if this fits here}

By all means, digitalizing real-world objects not only revolves on structured light but also may make use of range scanners, which measure the depth from the recording device to a point on the surface of the object. Additionally, this depth information may be combined from recording from multiple views. Assembling this information yields unstructured three-dimensional point cloud data. 

Similar to the marching cubes algorithm, the work presented by 
  Bernardini et al. \cite{817351}, the ball-pivoting algorithm, 
  interpolates the surface of an object given the input data.
  In contrast, the algorithm processes such a collection of unstructured 
  three-dimensional points in space with their orientation on the
  ground truth surface and returns a triangle mesh. Starting from
   a seed triangle, for each edge of not already processed triangles
   , a sphere with set radius $r$ revolves around it. If another point
    of the input point cloud intersects with the sphere, a triangle is 
    created out of the endpoints of the considered edge and the newly 
    found point, thus creating a triangle mesh if every edge of each 
    triangle has been considered. 
  

    Furthermore, the Poisson surface reconstruction, 
    presented by Kazhdan et al. \cite{Kazhdan:2006:PSR:1281957.1281965}, also processes a
     collection of unstructured points in three-dimensional
      space with surface orientation. Solving the Poisson problem 
      \cite{Genovese2006} assuming the isosurface of the surface can be 
      approximated by the normal field, thus yielding the
       indicator function. This function results in non-zero
        values close to the surface of the object and thereby 
        can be directly extracted. The problem is then reduced to a 
        form of voxel-grid, thus can be transformed by the marching
         cubes algorithm.

 Similarly, surface information can be reconstructed by calculating 
 the PC's medial axis transform ~(~MAT~) from unstructured point cloud
  data, followed by an inverse transformation.  The medial axis of a PC
   is described as a set of points where each point is the closest neighbor 
   to at least one other point in the original PC. Not only can the PC be noisy 
   or scanty, as described by Amenta et al. \cite{Groh2017}, but the reconstructed
    surface mesh will always be manifold.
